# QuickLinks 

Quicklinks is a VsCode extensions that lets you open up a browser tab to a URL from within the terminal.

## What's this about?

You can now open browser tabs to key websites straight from vscode.

For professionals, this means you can open tabs to Jira, StackOverflow, etc.

These quick links can be scoped to global, or just the workspace. This is useful if you're working on multiple repositories which have different links (think different Jira boards).

VSCode v1.105.0 or newer

## Known Issues

This extension is still in the early stage of development, I'm still trying to figure out what I'm doing.
